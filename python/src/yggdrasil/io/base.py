"""Cursor + tabular handle bound to a managed :class:`Holder`.

:class:`IO[T, O]` IS-A :class:`Tabular`. It is a **pure seekable
cursor over a :class:`Holder`** — every public op is "do this at the
cursor" and dispatches straight to the bound holder. The IO carries
no scratch buffer of its own; reads / writes / truncates flow through
the holder's positional API, so the holder remains the single source
of truth for the durable bytes.

On top of that cursor it implements the bytes surface (``read`` /
``write`` / ``seek`` / ``tell`` / positional reads / structured
primitives / codec-aware format helpers) and inherits the
row-oriented surface from :class:`Tabular` so byte-level and
Arrow-level operations live on the same handle.

The default :class:`IO` doesn't know what format its bytes encode,
so the two abstract :class:`Tabular` hooks
(:meth:`_read_arrow_batches` / :meth:`_write_arrow_batches`) raise
unless overridden. Format-specific leaves (Parquet, CSV, Arrow IPC,
…) subclass :class:`IO` and override the hooks against the same byte
holder.

*T* is the chunk type the concrete handle exposes (``bytes`` for the
canonical path); *O* is the :class:`CastOptions` subtype carried by
:class:`Tabular`. The generic split lets a future text-shaped or
block-shaped handle reuse the holder + cursor + lifecycle plumbing
without inheriting the bytes-specific helpers.

Construction shapes
-------------------

- **Borrow** — ``IO(holder=h)``. Closing the IO never touches *h*.
  Two cursors over a long-lived buffer:
  ``c1, c2 = IO(holder=mem), IO(holder=mem)``.
- **Own** — ``IO(holder=h, owns_holder=True)``. Closing the IO closes
  *h*. This is what :meth:`Holder.open` returns.
- **Auto** — ``IO(data)``, ``IO(path=...)``, ``IO(binary=...)``, or
  ``IO.from_(obj)`` route any bytes-like / path-like / file-like /
  holder input through the right :class:`Holder` constructor and
  return an owning IO.
- **Format dispatch** — ``IO(media_type="csv")``,
  ``IO(path="x.parquet")``, … resolve to the registered Tabular leaf
  (:class:`CsvIO`, :class:`ParquetIO`, …) automatically.

Lifecycle
---------

:meth:`_acquire` makes sure the holder is acquired (when owned),
applies the mode-driven side effects (``ERROR_IF_EXISTS`` guard,
``OVERWRITE`` / ``TRUNCATE`` zeroing the holder, ``APPEND``-style
cursor positioning) and returns. Reads and writes routed through the
IO between :meth:`_acquire` and :meth:`_release` go directly to the
durable holder. :meth:`_release` closes the holder when ``self`` owns
it; the holder honors its own :attr:`temporary` flag and discards the
payload at that point.

Modes
-----

Mode is stored as a typed :class:`Mode` enum. Construction accepts
the :class:`ModeLike` family (POSIX strings ``"rb"`` / ``"wb"`` /
``"ab"`` / ``"xb"`` plus ``+`` variants, human aliases, or the enum
directly). Effects on top of a holder:

- Initial cursor — :data:`Mode.APPEND` lands at EOF; everything else at 0.
- :meth:`readable` / :meth:`writable` reporting via Mode predicates.
- :data:`Mode.OVERWRITE` / :data:`Mode.TRUNCATE` truncate the holder on
  :meth:`_acquire`.
- :data:`Mode.ERROR_IF_EXISTS` raises :class:`FileExistsError` on
  :meth:`_acquire` when the holder is non-empty.

class IO(Holder, BinaryIO, Generic[T, O]):
    """Cursor + bytes surface + tabular view, IS-A :class:`Holder`.

    After the Holder ↔ IO merge, :class:`IO` inherits from
    :class:`Holder` directly — every IO instance IS a Holder, with
    the same storage primitives (``_read_mv`` / ``_write_mv`` /
    ``reserve`` / ``truncate`` / ``_clear`` / ``size`` / ``_stat``)
    and the same opt-in seekable cursor (``_pos`` / ``_mode``)
    exposed through ``cursor=True`` on the byte primitives.

    Also subclasses :class:`typing.BinaryIO` so external libraries
    that type-check against the stdlib file-like interface (pandas,
    pyarrow, zipfile, …) accept Yggdrasil byte buffers without a
    separate facade — the previous ``BytesIO`` shim is gone, every
    caller goes through :class:`IO` directly. :attr:`mode` returns
    the POSIX string (``"rb"`` / ``"wb+"`` / …) instead of the typed
    :class:`Mode` enum so pandas/zipfile's ``"b" in handle.mode``
    sniffs work; the typed value is still available via ``self._mode``.

    Two layered patterns survive the merge for backward compat:

    - **Self-storing IO** — the default. :class:`BytesIO` and the
      format leaves (:class:`ParquetIO`, :class:`CsvIO`, …) carry
      their own bytes via the inherited Holder primitives.
    - **Holder-wrapping IO** — opt-in via ``IO(holder=other_holder)``.
      The IO keeps a separate ``_holder`` pointer (e.g. a
      :class:`LocalPath` underneath a :class:`ParquetIO` cursor) and
      ``_active()`` redirects every byte op there. This is how
      ``LocalPath("data.parquet").open()`` produces a format-aware
      cursor against a path-backed buffer without copying bytes.

    Mode-aware but format-agnostic at this layer. Mode controls
    cursor position (:data:`Mode.APPEND` → EOF), :meth:`readable` /
    :meth:`writable` reporting, whether :meth:`_acquire` truncates
    the holder (:data:`Mode.OVERWRITE` / :data:`Mode.TRUNCATE`), and
    the :class:`FileExistsError` for :data:`Mode.ERROR_IF_EXISTS`.

    The two :class:`Tabular` batch hooks default to
    :class:`NotImplementedError` — a plain :class:`IO` doesn't know
    what its bytes encode. Format leaves override the hooks against
    the same byte buffer.
