# Yggdrasil

Distributed node framework — Python backend, Next.js frontend, Nordic dark UI.

## Coding Style

1. **Inline over micro-functions** — prefer inlining logic directly where it's used. Don't extract one-liner helpers, don't create utility functions called from a single site, don't wrap stdlib calls in project-specific wrappers. A 15-line method is better than 5 three-line functions calling each other. Extract only when the same logic appears 3+ times or the extracted function has genuine standalone semantics (e.g. `make_id`, `serialize_result`).
2. **Flat call stacks** — avoid deep delegation chains like `router → service → helper → sub-helper → util`. Routers call services. Services do the work. Two levels max for the common path.
3. **No defensive wrappers** — don't wrap `json.loads` in a `safe_parse_json`, don't wrap `Path.mkdir` in an `ensure_dir`. Call stdlib directly. Handle errors at the boundary where they matter.
4. **No premature abstraction** — three similar blocks of code is fine. A `BaseService` with one subclass is not. Don't create interfaces, registries, or plugin systems until the third concrete user exists.
5. **Collocate related code** — keep schemas, service logic, and the router for one concept readable together. Jumping between 5 files to understand one endpoint is worse than a 200-line service file.
6. **Delete dead code** — no commented-out blocks, no `# TODO: maybe later`, no unused imports. If it's not called, it doesn't exist.
7. **Prefer data over code** — dicts and lists over class hierarchies. Pydantic models over hand-rolled validation. Enum values over if/elif chains.

## Communication & Transport

1. **Arrow IPC for tabular data** — all structured data between nodes uses `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`. Use `transport.serialize_result` / `deserialize_result` which auto-dispatches: Arrow for tables/dataframes, yggdrasil pickle for complex Python objects.
2. **Stream everything** — SSE for logs, metrics, run state. Chunked HTTP for file transfer (64KB). Never buffer an entire large response in memory. Use `StreamingResponse` + async generators.
3. **Lazy by default** — don't fetch what you don't need. Directory listings are lazy (click to expand). File contents only on demand. Peer metadata cached with TTL, refreshed on access. Cache small payloads (<4MB) in `ExpiringDict`, stream anything larger.
4. **Connection pooling** — reuse `httpx.AsyncClient` per peer node instead of creating one per request. The `NetworkService` owns the pool.
5. **Content-addressed assets** — every asset (PyFunc, PyEnv, DAG) has a `content_hash` (sha256 of defining content). Two assets with the same hash are identical regardless of which node created them. Use hash for fast replication diff: only replicate what changed.

## Asset Design

1. **Self-describing** — every asset carries all metadata to rebuild it anywhere: code, dependencies, python version, content hash. No external references that can't be resolved.
2. **Cross-references by hash** — when a PyFuncRun references a PyFunc and PyEnv, it stores their content hashes. A receiving node can verify it has the right versions or request them.
3. **Multi-Python via uv** — `PyEnv` specifies `python_version` (3.11, 3.12, 3.13). `uv venv --python X.Y` creates isolated envs. Code is replicable across nodes with different system Pythons because uv downloads the right interpreter.
4. **Dependency inference** — `@function` decorator infers dependencies from AST import analysis. Explicitly listed deps override inference. Dependencies are part of the content hash.

## Permissions & Security Posture

1. **User identity** — every request carries a user identity (sha256 hash of key+hostname). `UserService` auto-registers the local user and discovers peers.
2. **Open by default** — all operations are allowed for all users. Permission checks are a middleware concern, not service logic. The `user_hash` is logged on every mutation for audit trail, but never blocks.
3. **Audit log** — mutations (create, update, delete, replicate) log `(timestamp, user_hash, operation, asset_hash)`. Read-only operations are not logged.
4. **Node acts as user** — the node operates with the current user's full permissions. It can read/write files, install packages (`uv pip`, `npm install`), spawn subprocesses, execute arbitrary Python received over HTTP. There is no sandboxing, no syscall jail, no capability filter — the node IS the user's workstation, exposed as an HTTP API.
5. **Intentional, not accidental** — POC mode prioritizes velocity and ergonomics over isolation. Running the node bound to a public interface on a hostile network is unsupported. For multi-tenant isolation, run one node per tenant in a VM or container and federate them via the v2 network mesh.
6. **Secrets handling** — environment-variable secrets live in `~/.node/.env` (gitignored). The node never persists API keys to its asset store; replicated PyFuncs carry code only, not the env they execute in.

## Auto-configuration

1. **Zero-config decorators** — `@function` infers name, code, dependencies, python version. `@function(auto_env=True)` also creates a matching PyEnv with the right Python version and deps.
2. **Auto-env creation** — when a function is registered without an explicit environment, the system auto-creates one named `auto_{func_name}` with inferred deps.
3. **Multi-python** — `uv venv --python 3.11/3.12/3.13` creates isolated envs. Code is replicable across nodes with different system Pythons.
4. **Auto-install on start** — `ygg node start` auto-registers systemd/launchd boot services so the node survives reboots.

## Principles

1. **Exceptions** — derive from `YGGException`. API errors use `yggdrasil.exceptions.api`. No ad-hoc exception classes.
2. **Services own logic** — routers are thin. Business rules + state live in `services/`.
3. **Schemas are contracts** — `StrictModel` (extra="forbid") for all request/response types.
4. **Streaming first** — use SSE for logs, metrics, long-running operations.
5. **POC mode** — ship fast, iterate. No legacy compat.
6. **Int64 IDs** — prefer `int` over string UUIDs. Use xxhash-based composites: `xxh32(semantic_key) << 32 | timestamp_ms`. Two xxhash int64s are acceptable when coupling different concepts. Never use cryptographic hashes for IDs.
7. **Upsert by default** — POST endpoints create if name not found, update if it exists. ID is immutable once assigned.

## Node v2 API (PyEnv / PyFunc / PyFuncRun)

Core concepts — workstation as remote executor/driver:

- **PyEnv** — Python environment (uv venv). Has `execute_pyfunc()` for inner dispatch.
- **PyFunc** — Executable (code + deps + metadata). Upserted by name.
- **PyFuncRun** — Execution = PyEnv + PyFunc + args/kwargs + metadata.
- **DAG** — Composed of sub-PyFuncs with edges, cross-node orchestration.
- **Backend** — Node metadata: CPU, RAM, GPU, disk, network metrics (SSE streaming).
- **Network** — Peer mesh. Nodes swap roles (driver/executor/hybrid). Arrow IPC transport.

## Python Decorator Framework

```python
from yggdrasil.node.fn import function, dag

@function
def process(data: list) -> dict:
    import pandas as pd
    return {"count": len(data)}

# Call like a normal function — returns FunctionRun (Future-like)
run = process([1, 2, 3])
result = run.wait()          # block until done
result = run.wait(wait=10)   # timeout after 10s (uses WaitingConfig)

# Target a specific environment or remote node
run = process.with_env("ml-env")([1, 2, 3])
run = process.on("http://node-2:8100")([1, 2, 3])

# DAG chaining with >> operator
pipeline = dag("etl", extract >> transform >> load)
run = pipeline()
```

The `@function` decorator infers: name, source code, dependencies (AST), python version. `FunctionRun` integrates with `WaitingConfig`, `State` enum, and polls the node API.

## CLI

`ygg node start` — background daemon (auto-installs boot service)
`ygg node stop` — stop the daemon
`ygg node create <name>` — create named node at `~/.node/<name>/`
`ygg node serve` — foreground server + frontend
`ygg node status` — show pid, port, boot service state
`ygg node run <func>` — call a @remote function
`ygg databricks` — Databricks management CLI

## Environment

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `YGG_NODE_PORT` | 8100 | Node port |
| `YGG_NODE_FRONT_PORT` | 3000 | Frontend port |
| `BOT_API_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8100` | Frontend → node proxy |
